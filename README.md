Mechy†
------

This is a mechanical keyboard library, in the same spirit as QMK but it doesn't share any code with that project.  I haven't added support for multiple layers yet because I don't personally use them.

Mechy is designed around C++ keyboard `Plugin` classes, and included in the main bundle are a bunch of example (and useful) plugins.

Includes support for split keyboards, see the example files.

- Numpad.ino
- Main.ino
- Worker.ino
