Mechy†
------

This is a mechanical keyboard library, in the same spirit as QMK but it doesn't share any code with that project.  I haven't added support for multiple layers yet because I don't personally use them.

Mechy is designed around C++ keyboard `Plugin` classes, and included in the main bundle are a bunch of example (and useful) plugins.

Includes support for split keyboards, see the example files.

- Basic.ino - I copied and modified my XD75 layout
- Numpad.ino - simple 4x5 layout
- LeftSplit.ino - left side of a BFO9000 keyboard
- RightSplit.ino - right side of a BFO9000 keyboard

† *pronounced "Mech Key", if that wasn't obvious*
